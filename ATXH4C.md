[These are issues](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AATXHack4Change) we've decided to focus on for the ATX Hack for Change weekend.

To provide some more context, here is a high level overview of what we are focused on next:

### Turn the curriculum (which is a PDF right now) into a website.
- [Designers & HTML/CSS Coders needed to liberate curriculum from PDF](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/128)

### Create a District Profile Lookup tool

- [Data viz designers & developers needed to create a District Profile tool](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/80)
- This would be for students/citizens to view demographic breakdowns of each City Council district and look up who their Councilmember is.

###  Add Budget Data Visulizations
- Data viz designers & developers needed [todo: make issue]()
- Within Budget Party, incorporate a pie chart or another useful visualization that allows you to see what percentage of the City's General Fund is going to each department. Figure out how this fits into the exisitng flow of the app.

### Make Budget Party work for other cities
- To do this, we need to start abstracting the City specific logic.
- And moving city specific details into easily editable config files.

### Polish up the budget party app by reporting bugs, fixing bugs, adding enhancements.
