[These are issues](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AATXHack4Change) we've decided to focus on for the ATX Hack for Change weekend.

To provide some more context, here is a high level overview of what we are focused on next:

1. Turn the curriculum (which is a PDF right now) into a website.
    - [Designers & HTML/CSS Coders needed to liberate curriculum from PDF](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/128)
1. Create a District Profile lookup so students/citizens can view demographic breakdowns of each City Council district and look up who their Councilmember is.
    - [Data viz designers & developers needed to create a District Profile tool](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/80)
1. Within Budget Party, incorporate a pie chart or another useful visualization that allows you to see what percentage of the City's General Fund is going to each department. Figure out how this fits into the exisitng flow of the app.
    - [Data viz designers & developers needed]()
1. Start abstracting the City specific logic so we could stand up versions of Budget Party for other cities.
1. Polish up the budget party app by reporting bugs, fixing bugs, adding more department icons, improving the way we use our Firebase backend.
    1. 🔥 🗄️ Firebase is our backend system for authentication and NoSQL database services. We need to do a couple things to make our React/Redux app play more nicely with Firebase.
    - [🗝️ Update Anonoymous Auth to the Firebase way](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/132)
    1. [🐛 Bugs](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
    1. [✍️ Policy Research/Writers needed to look up and update budget numbers](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/134)
